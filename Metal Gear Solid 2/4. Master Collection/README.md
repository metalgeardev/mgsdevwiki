--------------------

WIP: 

Info dump below this line. 

LT2 from OG PS2 are directly compatible

1. Bluepoint converted all the textures to ctxr and models to cmdl, but for some reason they kept all the original model files as well (evm, kms, cv2, zms, etc)
    
2. _[_12:08 PM_]_
    
    Well, shipped the game with them I mean.
    
3. _[_12:09 PM_]_
    
    They kept the .tri files too but where the texture data should be was made null so they're only using the header info.
